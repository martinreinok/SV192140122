# Grade administration system
This grade administration system can be used to keep track of courses, grades and students through a textual interface. Be aware that before a student's grade can be registered, (s)he is expected to be enrolled in this course first. The amount of credits that a student has earned is automatically calculated based on whether (s)he got a passing grade (6 or higher) in the courses for which (s)he has been enrolled.

## Compiling and running the application with Larva
Compiling the larva code can be done by executing the script './compile.sh'.
Note that this assumes that your Larva code can be found in 'GradeAdministration.lrv'.
If you want to run the application when the larva has been compiled, simply execute the script './run.sh'.
